In revealing the Counsels of our Enemies, when the Discoveries were seasonable and important, and the Means seemingly adequate or fortuitous. In preserving and even improving the Union of several States, on the Breach of which our Enemies placed their greatest Dependence. In increasing the Number and adding the Zeal and Attachment of the Friends of Liberty. In granting remarkable Deliverances, and blessing us with the most signal Success when Affairs seemed to have the most discouraging Appearance. In raising up for us a powerful and generous Ally, in one of the first of the European powers. In confounding the Counsels of our Enemies and suffering them to pursue such Measures as have most directly contributed to frustrate their own Desires and Expectations.

In which, The Confederation of the United States has been completed. In which, There have been so many Instances of Prowess and Success in our Armies, particularly in the Southern States, where, notwithstanding the Difficulties with which they had to struggle, they have recovered the whole Country which the Enemy had overrun, leaving them only a Post or two on or near the Sea. In which, We have been so powerfully and effectually assisted by our Allies, while in all the conjunct Operations, the most perfect Harmony has subsisted in the Allied Army. In which, There has been so plentiful a Harvest, and so great Abundance of the Fruits of the Earth of every Kind, as not only enables us easily to supply the Wants of our Army, but gives Comfort and Happiness to the whole People: And, In which, After the Success of our Allies by Sea, a General of the first Rank, with his whole Army, has been captured by the allied Forces under the Direction of our Commander in Chief.</span></p>

Simple Product,0,1789 Original Watts' Hymnal Page,Original Watts' Hymnal Page,"<p>As we have amassed one of America’s largest collections of original documents from the Founding Era, we occasionally come across books that, while falling apart on the outside, have pages that are still in great condition. In those cases, we can either repair the book or take the outer shells off and do something unique: offer a way for you to own a piece of history. This time, we are offering a page from an original <em>Isaac Watts' Hymnal</em>.</p>
<p>Isaac Watts (1674-1748) is known as the “Father of English Hymnody” and in addition to well-known hymns like <em>Joy to the World</em>, <em>When I Survey the Wondrous Cross</em>, <em>At the Cross</em> and many other timeless pieces, he also set the entire book of Psalms to music. Interestingly, early hymnals did not include musical notation, but only the words of the hymn. The melodies came from already known songs, or from a cantor who sang the tune in the congregation.</p>
<p><em>Watts' Hymnal</em> played a significant role in the American Revolution and during early American education. When you buy a page, you will also receive a sheet with history on Isaac Watts and the use of the hymnal in early America. This will be a treasured keepsake that you can pass down for generations, or a unique gift you can give to that person who always “has everything.”</p>
<p>This 4""x6"" page comes in an attractive display folder that also gives historical accounts regarding Isaac Watts and his hymnal.</p>",1,WH1,no,taxable,media,yes,63,FALSE,FALSE,0,no,50,No Backorders,FALSE,1,25,,FALSE,FALSE,29.99,0,0.1625,2,18,2,Browse All;Prints;

Humbly supplicate the Supreme Ruler of the Universe to prosper the Administration of the Federal Government, and that of this Commonwealth, and the other States in the Union; enduing them with Firmness, Wisdom, Unanimity and Public Spirit; and leading them in their respective public Councils, to such Determinations as shall be adapted to Promote the great end of Government: The Welfare and Happiness of the People: To restore and maintain Peace in our Borders: Continue Health among us, and give us Wisdom to improve His Blessings, for His Glory, and our own Good:? To smile upon our Agriculture, and mercifully prevent the diminishing the Fruits of the Earth, by devouring Insects, unseasonable Weather, or other Judgments; that so our Land may abundantly yield its Increase: That He would protect and prosper our Navigation, Trade, Fishery, and all the Works of our Hands: To confirm and continue our invaluable Religious and Civil Liberties: To prosper the University, and other Seminaries and Means of Education: To cause Industry, Frugality, and all Moral and Christian Virtues to prevail among us: To bless the Allies of the United Sates, and particularly to afford his Almighty Aid to the French Nation, and still Guide them into such Measures, as shall tend effectually to establish a Government founded upon Reason, Justice, and the Welfare of the People.

Collins explores the spiritual side of Abraham Lincoln by using his own words as a source, as well as insight from his family and friends. Collins also adds a personal dimension by telling the story as a first person account. By doing this, he hoped the readers would feel as if he, or she, was part of the events as they happened.<br /><br />This volume of ABRAHAM LINCOLN: GOD'S LEADERS FOR A NATION, joins the collections of inspiring biographies writen by one of America's foremost authors of children's literature.

But recent generations no longer understand the foundations upon which America was built. As a consequence, there is now a visible erosion of the unique principles that produced the success we long enjoyed. How do we recover and restore what is now being lost?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000;"">Discover the historical and Biblical guidelines that helped individuals, families, businesses, and the nation become successful. Fortunately, these principles are timeless and therefore are still relevant today. If America is to be restored, Americans must rediscover the truth about our past and begin once again applying the principles that produce success.</span></p>

Washington took these rules to heart and they strongly influenced him throughout his life. Many of the rules deal with etiquette, and many others concern deeper matters that touch on self-respect, wise judgment, honor, success, and integrity. These rules give a glimpse into the habits and manners of the Founding Era, but they are timeless principles still relevant for all ages today.</span></span></span></p>

Noted historian David Barton now sets the record straight.</p>
<p>Having borne the brunt of a smear campaign that started more than two centuries ago, the reputation and character of American president Thomas Jefferson shows considerable tarnish, as lies and misunderstandings have gathered on his legacy.</p>
<p>Noted early-America historian David Barton scours out the truth.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Jefferson and Sally: Did he really have children by his slave, Sally Hemings?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Jefferson and Jesus: Did he really abandon the faith of his family?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Jefferson and the Bible: Did he really want to rewrite the Scripture?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Jefferson and the church: Did he really advocate separation?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Jefferson and slaves: What is the truth about his slaveholding and his statements that all are created equal?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Jefferson and education: Did Jefferson really found the first secular, irreligious university?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these questions deserve the cleansing light of truth. Barton has gone through the historical records, combed the original documents and letters, and examined the recent evidence, and his findings will upset the establishment. Barton shows the true man, the Real Thomas Jefferson. Most readers will have the joy and surprise of meeting him for the very first time.</p>

<div id=""hideshow"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>In today’s classrooms and civil arenas you will find little evidence of the Biblical principles upon which America was founded. In fact, many modern-day historians claim that our nation’s Founders were a diverse group of atheists, deists, and political revolutionaries. But what principles did the Founding Fathers use as the basis for the most successful nation in history? Did they really intend for us to live in a secular society as revisionists claim? Or were they largely a group of God-fearing leaders who believed that Biblical principles should form the underpinning of our government and its Constitution? Discover the amazing truth of our nation’s Godly foundation in the American Heritage Series. America: this is your heritage!</p>

<div id=""hideshow2"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>In today’s society, Americans are increasingly taught false views about the religious and moral beliefs of our Founding Fathers. Were our Founding Fathers rebellious political zealots as many historians now teach? Or were they really men of integrity and strong religious character, as earlier generations and textbooks taught? View original documents that show, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that America’s Founders drew their ideas for this nation from their strong faith in God. As you watch, you will see numerous accounts of God’s intervention clearly visible in the lives and endeavors of our Founding Fathers. In the American Heritage Series, discover the faith of our Founders that enabled them selflessly to give their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor. America: this is your heritage!</p>

<div id=""hideshow3"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>Modern history teaches us that our Founding Fathers were atheists, agnostics, and deists yet a closer look into history tells us a different story. America’s founders were united by their deeply held spiritual beliefs, and those beliefs directly impacted the formation of the new nation. Significantly, the Bible was the source of many of the unique ideas and unprecedented principles laid out in our founding documents, but today we are no longer taught these truths about our founding; instead, we are taught a revisionist history in which religious faith is absent and God’s Providential hand is ignored.

<div id=""hideshow4"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>In present-day politics and government, the term ""separation of church and state"" is regularly used to prohibit expressions of religious faith in the public arena. However, for a century-and-a-half after the Constitution was written, that phrase meant exactly the opposite – it was used to preserve religious expressions <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">in</span></em> the public square. What was the origin of this now infamous phrase? When and how did its meaning change? Learn the history of this phrase and how its original meaning has been replaced with a completely secular one never intended by the author of the phrase.

<div id=""hideshow5"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>During the Revolutionary War, churches and clergy played a pivotal role, providing leadership in the political and military arenas and helping shape the intellectual ideas that took root in our founding documents. The Bible helped shape our nation’s government, educational system, and culture in general; and while today’s critics have relegated religious leaders to serving only within the four walls of the church, America’s early religious leaders believed that they were to be involved in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">every</span> aspect of life – including government. Is there still a role for churches and pastors to play in today’s political arena?

<div id=""hideshow6"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>Founding Father Alexander Hamilton announced to the nation during the ratification of the Constitution that, ""[T]he judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution. . . . [and] the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter."" Yet today, our religious freedoms and so many others of our once inalienable rights are now regularly threatened by this ""least dangerous"" branch.

<p>If a picture is truly worth a thousand words, what then do the pictures, monuments, and great art of our nation’s Capitol tell us about American history and our nation’s Founders? Many visitors to the Capitol would be shocked to discover that the faith of our Founding Fathers has been chiseled in stone throughout that great building. What is the meaning behind some of our nation’s most baffling symbols, from the dollar bill’s ""all-seeing eye,"" to the towering national monuments of Washington, DC?

<div id=""hideshow8"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>For centuries, America’s educational philosophy centered on teaching ""religion, morality, and knowledge"" – the three aspects set forward in 1789 in America’s first federal law addressing education. In fact, America’s great Founding Fathers and educational leaders spoke openly about the need for public education to inculcate these three elements. However, over the past half-century, a dramatic change has occurred, and a completely secular philosophy now dominates the American classroom. In fact, most Americans today are not only uninformed but often misinformed about the spiritual heritage of our nation and its Founders. What can history tell us about a nation who forgets its past? Is revisionism in textbooks really a problem? Discover the remarkable history of American education in the American Heritage Series. America: this is your heritage!</p>

<p>Unknown to most today, black and white soldiers often fought side-by-side in the fierce battles of the Revolutionary War that birthed our nation, and many black leaders played pivotal roles in our government in the 1700s and throughout the 1800s. Why do our classrooms neglect so many of our nation’s great black leaders – military heroes such as Peter Salem, influential pastors like Lemuel Haynes and Richard Allen, Revolutionary spy James Armistead, or U. S. Congressman Joseph Hayne Rainey? Learn about these remarkable leaders and their great spiritual faith, and discover little known facts about the early civil rights movement.

<div id=""hideshow10"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>Over the past two centuries, a dramatic change has occurred in America. The rich spiritual heritage of our Founding Fathers and the religious beliefs and values they incorporated through American government and institutions are now met with increasing hostility. Are we really in what many describe as a ""Cultural War""? Does the mixing of politics and faith create a dangerous environment within a nation, or does it actually preserve the unique principles that made the United States the most successful nation in history? In the American Heritage Series, discover the role that Biblical values played in our founding, how far America has drifted since that time, and what citizens today can do to return to restore those values.

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em>David Livingstone: African Explorer</em></span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">David Livingstone was one of the greatest explorers who ever lived. His exciting exploits in Africa tell a story of unsurpassed courage and determination. At first, it looked like David Livingstone would spend his life in the little town of Blantyre, Scotland. At age ten he began working in the cotton spinning mill. Everyday after work he attended school for two hours.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">He was told he'd never escape the daily toil of the cotton mill. Yet with only slight formal education, he succeeded in gaining admission to college. He studied to be a medical missionary. He attended a lecture by Robert Moffat, who was from Africa. Robert Moffat said, ""I have sometimes seen, in the morning sun, the smoke of a thousand villages, where no missionary has ever been.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">The phrase ""the smoke from a thousand villages"" caught David's imagination. He decided to go to Africa. Africa was being explored one cautious step at a time. David Livingstone made bold, sweeping trips far beyond the established line. Within a few months he'd gone deeper into Africa than any other missionary. He left the comfortable missionary stations and lived with the African people. He learned their language. He treated their sick, helped them build a better life for themselves and told them about Jesus. He made plans to explore Africa, to preach the Gospel, and learn the scientific secrets of this great country.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">David Livingstone described in vivid detail the unusual plants and animals of the African landscape. Using the same skills as a navigator on the ocean, he recorded his route into Africa so carefully it can be retraced today. His methods set a standard in the way exploration should be done.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">As he grew more confident, David made a daring decision. He would cross from one side of Africa to the other. Many people said it couldn't be done. David had learned to think for himself and never give up. He said, ""I will open a path into the interior or perish."" How he succeeded against all the odds is an exciting story. Read on and let the adventure begin!<br /><br /></span></p>

Night after night she walked among the cots of wounded soldiers, carrying her kerosene lamp to light the darkness and wearing her cape to keep out the cold. She was always ready to bandage the wounds of a bleeding soldier, give a drink of water to a thirsty patient, or write a letter home for a private on his deathbed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Up until Florence's time, the hospitals in England were a disgrace. Could she better conditions? She would have to overcome the resistance of high officials, the apathy of the public, and even the ignorance of doctors.

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;"">George Frideric Handel: Composer of <em>Messiah<br /><br /></em></span></strong><span style=""font-size: small;"">Listening to, or participating in, the singing of Handel's <em>Messiah</em> is now as much a part of Christmas celebrations as the buying of gifts. And that experience will be richer yet for people who realize the series of miracles that were required to bring this oratorio into being.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">While a lad of seven, Handel's barber-surgeon father assured him that he would rather his son's fingers be cut off than that he become a musician. To emphasize this, he burned all of the boy's musical toys in the fireplace. Nonetheless, young George Frideric continued to practice on a muted clavichord hidden in the attic.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Later, Handel had to overcome a paralysis of his right arm. Shortly before working on Messiah, he was so pressed for money he feared debtor's prison. Yet Providence brought him to that momentous time in his life. After composing the ""Hallelujah Chorus,"" he exclaimed through tears to a servant, ""I did think I did see all heaven before me, and the great God Himself!""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">At the first London performance of the <em>Messiah</em>, King George II rose to his feet during the singing of the ""Hallelujah Chorus,"" and since he was King, the rest of the audience rose with him. Thus began the custom which continues to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Altogether, Handel composed as much music as the combined works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig Beethoven. Much of his music still lives to glorify the God whom Handel served with his great talent.<br /><br /></span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em>Jason Lee: Winner of the Northwest<br /></em></span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">The four Indians swam rivers, hid from hostile Indians, hunted for food, sometimes lived on only berries and fruit. ""My moccasins are worn out,"" said one, and no wonder. They had traveled nearly 3000 miles on foot. For what? To seek the Book of Heaven from the white man.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">The story captured the imaginations and hearts of Christendom. Methodists responded by sending Jason Lee to Oregon. Lee loved the Northwest when he read about it, and he loved it even more when he reached the end of the Oregon Trail and saw its rivers and forests and fertile soil and its Indians and rugged pioneers. So, he built his mission on the banks of the Willamette. He spoke in churches urging people to move to the land of the setting sun and help to build a Christian Oregon. He lobbied Congress to establish Oregon as a Territory.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Tragedy stalked Jason, and he died in the noon of life, so he had no opportunity to enjoy triumph. But in after years, when the state needed to select two of its native sons to honor in the Statuary Hall of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., it was obvious to its citizens that one of them should be Jason Lee. Today his statue stands not only in the National Hall, but also on the lawn of Oregonians' own Capitol Building in Salem. And nearby is a statue of a Methodist circuit rider, reminding viewers of the part the Book of Heaven played in the history of the Northwest.<br /><br /></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Too often scientists build their theories upon wild speculation or unfounded assumptions. Many new ideas turn out to be dead-ends. They neither advance science nor improve daily life. Some people distrust the claims of science. Can science really change the world?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Yes, indeed. The scientific discoveries of Louis Pasteur, a Frenchman who lived in the 1800s, have made a difference. He chose scientific questions worthy of attack, those whose solution would benefit ordinary citizens. Pasteurization grew out of his dramatic discovery that tiny living things cause foods like milk to spoil. Gentle heating of the milk destroys the tiny life and keeps the food fresh.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">He also proved that some microscopic living organisms are helpful to human beings, while others cause illness. His discovery that germs can cause disease is the foundation of modern medicine. It took a great deal of effort to prove the germ theory. Truth, not fleeting fame, motivated Louis Pasteur. He announced his results only after the most careful research in the laboratory and thorough tests in the field.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Some scientists resented it when Louis Pasteur showed the error in their favorite theories. Biologist violently opposed his proof that microscopic life could not spring into existence from nonliving elements. Veterinarians belittled his development of vaccines for chicken cholera and anthrax. Surgeons ignored his call for germ-free operating rooms to prevent infections during surgery. Doctors rejected the evidence that germs cause disease. These traditional-minded scientists launched personal attacks against Louis Pasteur. Louis Pasteur, however, didn't settle questions by arguments. He held dramatic public demonstrations so people could judge for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">If you listed the top ten scientists of all time, you would include Louis Pasteur near the top of the list. Yet, this great man was very religious, a Christian. Many times, he stated his belief that spiritual and religious values go beyond scientific knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Read <em>Louis Pasteur - Founder of Modern Medicine.</em> It traces in exciting details the events in the life of Louis Pasteur. Learn about his early life as the son of an obscure country tanner. Experience his years of struggle as an unknown scientist. Enjoy his triumph as one of the world's most celebrated heroes.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em>Noah Webster: Master of Words</em></span></strong><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small;"">Noah Webster might be best known for his complete dictionary that many of us still use today. However, he penned many other works. Do you know which of his works he was most pleased with? Webster's fondness for language was quite obvious throughout his life, but David R. Collins also highlights his love for education, his country and most importantly, God. Webster observed, ""What a man does with his life may or may not be remembered after he is gone. That does not matter. What matters is that a man's actions are worthy in the eyes of God and useful to his fellow man. I pray my life has been of worth and usefulness."" You will find that this biography gives you a portrait of how Webster made strides throughout his entire life to meet that standard.</span></p>

He was born to one of the richest families on earth, but he chose to live a simple life. Robert became one of the greatest scientists of all time, but remained a shy, humble person. Despite his quiet nature, he worked forcefully and bravely against persecution and injustice. His friends were a roll call of the famous: Christopher Wren, Samuel Pepys, John Milton, Isaac Newton and many others. Yet, during his life Robert Boyle towered over all of them.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Robert's brothers and sisters all received regal titles such as knight, viscount, earl, lord. However, Robert Boyle refused all titles. He preferred to remain what he was, a Christian gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Robert Boyle's father came to Ireland with nothing but a few coins in his pocket and a small trunk of clothes. He became the Great Earl of Cork, a powerful and wealthy Irish landowner. Like his father, Robert Boyle became famous, but in an entirely different way. He became the best known and most respected scientist of his day. Today, after three hundred years, he is still considered one of the top scientists of all time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Robert Boyle survived rebellions in Ireland, the English Civil War, the Black Death, the Great Fire and political unrest. He succeeded in making many remarkable discoveries during those difficult times. He lived a devout Christian life, using his science to glorify God.

<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">The world-famous artist, Samuel Morse, boarded the packet ship <em>Sully</em> in France to sail for New York. He listened as other passengers tossed ideas back and forth. One man asked, ""Is the flow of electricity slowed by the length of a wire?"" Someone else responded, ""No.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">The thought captured Samuel's imagination. Could signals be sent instantly anywhere along a wire by electricity? Could newspapers in America carry news of events that had taken place that very morning in Europe? But an idea is not enough. It must be expressed in terms of wire, magnets, and batteries. He filled his notebook with dozens of drawings - diagrams of wire circuits, electromagnets, levers, switches, a moving strip of paper.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Life with Samuel took Susanna from her life-long home in London to a new home over a hundred miles to the north. Samuel was a minister, but life in the rectory was not easy. There was never enough money to feed and clothe the family properly. Twice their house burned.

How could she make time to spend alone with each of her children? When should she teach the children to read? And would her life ever count for something? As a young woman, Susanna once said, ""I hope the fire I start will not only burn all of London, but all of the United Kingdom as well.

<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Safely in the air, Wilbur warped the wings. There was an instant response and Wilbur glowed with joy.

<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">On his fifth flight that day, Wilbur became aware of increasing instability. Then the left wing dipped far too deeply. Frantically he pushed the elevator control. He was too late. The tip of the left wing bit into the sand and he was hurled forward against the canvas elevator.</span></p>

William Jennings Bryan was about to speak. He stood tall and strong, a handsome figure, smartly dressed, in western boots.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">Everywhere Bryan spoke, excited crowds cheered and applauded. He was called the golden-tongued orator yet he was known as the Great Commoner, fighting for the common people against the power of big corporation and monopolies, fighting against evils in society and government.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">Bryan could help even the children in his audiences to understand the big issues. ""When you buy one dollar's worth of starch,"" he said in a farming town, ""you pay sixty cents for the starch and forty cents for the trusts and the tariff.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">As a schoolboy, Bryan failed to place at all in the first speech contest he entered. Practicing in the fields and woods, speaking with pebbles in his mouth as he heard Demosthenes of ancient Greece had done, planning all year long for upcoming contests, he began to win prizes.

<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">The mainsail cracked above them in the ferocious wind as a group of red-faced men descended on John. ""You have brought a curse on us. Overboard with you,"" one of the men yelled. A chorus of cheers went up. It was the last sound John heard before he was dumped over the side of the ship and engulfed by the dark, roiling ocean.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Thrown overboard, enslaved by the Turks, captured by pirates, rescued by a princess-the story of Englishman John Smith (1580-1631) would seem unbelievable were it fiction. Young John first sought adventure in Europe, traveling as far as Russia and distinguishing himself in the wars that raged across the Old World.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">But John Smith's real passion was for the New World, and in 1607 he sailed to North America with the men who would establish the first lasting British settlement-Jamestown. There he fought level-headedly for the policies that would enable the fragile community to survive starvation, disease, and deadly attacks to become a foothold in the New World.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em>David Livingstone: African Explorer</em></span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">David Livingstone was one of the greatest explorers who ever lived. His exciting exploits in Africa tell a story of unsurpassed courage and determination. At first, it looked like David Livingstone would spend his life in the little town of Blantyre, Scotland. At age ten he began working in the cotton spinning mill. Everyday after work he attended school for two hours.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">He was told he'd never escape the daily toil of the cotton mill. Yet with only slight formal education, he succeeded in gaining admission to college. He studied to be a medical missionary. He attended a lecture by Robert Moffat, who was from Africa. Robert Moffat said, ""I have sometimes seen, in the morning sun, the smoke of a thousand villages, where no missionary has ever been.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">The phrase ""the smoke from a thousand villages"" caught David's imagination. He decided to go to Africa. Africa was being explored one cautious step at a time. David Livingstone made bold, sweeping trips far beyond the established line. Within a few months he'd gone deeper into Africa than any other missionary. He left the comfortable missionary stations and lived with the African people. He learned their language. He treated their sick, helped them build a better life for themselves and told them about Jesus. He made plans to explore Africa, to preach the Gospel, and learn the scientific secrets of this great country.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">David Livingstone described in vivid detail the unusual plants and animals of the African landscape. Using the same skills as a navigator on the ocean, he recorded his route into Africa so carefully it can be retraced today. His methods set a standard in the way exploration should be done.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">As he grew more confident, David made a daring decision. He would cross from one side of Africa to the other. Many people said it couldn't be done. David had learned to think for himself and never give up. He said, ""I will open a path into the interior or perish."" How he succeeded against all the odds is an exciting story. Read on and let the adventure begin!</span></p>

In their new book,&nbsp;<strong><em>U-Turn: Restoring America to the Strength of Its Roots,&nbsp;</em></strong>historian David Barton and researcher/pollster George Barna examine the cultural trends of the past forty years, giving readers a unique view of the current moral and spiritual condition of Americans while providing specific recommendations on how we can restore our families, churches and government back to a place of Biblical conformity, and thus God's blessing.</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><br /></span></span></p>

Washington took these rules to heart and they strongly influenced him throughout his life. Many of the rules deal with etiquette, and many others concern deeper matters that touch on self-respect, wise judgment, honor, success, and integrity. These rules give a glimpse into the habits and manners of the Founding Era, but they are timeless principles still relevant for all ages today.</span><br /></span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;"">George Frideric Handel: Composer of <em>Messiah<br /><br /></em></span></strong><span style=""font-size: small;"">Listening to, or participating in, the singing of Handel's <em>Messiah</em> is now as much a part of Christmas celebrations as the buying of gifts. And that experience will be richer yet for people who realize the series of miracles that were required to bring this oratorio into being.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">While a lad of seven, Handel's barber-surgeon father assured him that he would rather his son's fingers be cut off than that he become a musician. To emphasize this, he burned all of the boy's musical toys in the fireplace. Nonetheless, young George Frideric continued to practice on a muted clavichord hidden in the attic.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Later, Handel had to overcome a paralysis of his right arm. Shortly before working on Messiah, he was so pressed for money he feared debtor's prison. Yet Providence brought him to that momentous time in his life. After composing the ""Hallelujah Chorus,"" he exclaimed through tears to a servant, ""I did think I did see all heaven before me, and the great God Himself!""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">At the first London performance of the <em>Messiah</em>, King George II rose to his feet during the singing of the ""Hallelujah Chorus,"" and since he was King, the rest of the audience rose with him. Thus began the custom which continues to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Altogether, Handel composed as much music as the combined works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig Beethoven. Much of his music still lives to glorify the God whom Handel served with his great talent.</span></p>

For years, Americans saw the Bible as a practical guidebook for directing every aspect of daily life, and it therefore shaped American government, law, and education as well as our free enterprise system, our views of private property, our social services, and so much more. This inspiring video presentation documents the dramatic impact of the Bible on American life and culture over the past four centuries.</span></p>

This time, we are offering a page from an original <em>Isaac Watts' Hymnal</em>.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em>Jason Lee: Winner of the Northwest<br /></em></span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">The four Indians swam rivers, hid from hostile Indians, hunted for food, sometimes lived on only berries and fruit. ""My moccasins are worn out,"" said one, and no wonder. They had traveled nearly 3000 miles on foot. For what? To seek the Book of Heaven from the white man.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">The story captured the imaginations and hearts of Christendom. Methodists responded by sending Jason Lee to Oregon. Lee loved the Northwest when he read about it, and he loved it even more when he reached the end of the Oregon Trail and saw its rivers and forests and fertile soil and its Indians and rugged pioneers. So, he built his mission on the banks of the Willamette. He spoke in churches urging people to move to the land of the setting sun and help to build a Christian Oregon. He lobbied Congress to establish Oregon as a Territory.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Tragedy stalked Jason, and he died in the noon of life, so he had no opportunity to enjoy triumph. But in after years, when the state needed to select two of its native sons to honor in the Statuary Hall of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., it was obvious to its citizens that one of them should be Jason Lee. Today his statue stands not only in the National Hall, but also on the lawn of Oregonians' own Capitol Building in Salem. And nearby is a statue of a Methodist circuit rider, reminding viewers of the part the Book of Heaven played in the history of the Northwest.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">John Quincy Adams served America for nearly seven decades of public service. During America’s early years, as we were struggling to become an established nation, he spent years overseas as a leading American diplomat to key nations, securing their support and cooperation for our fledgling nation. He dearly loved his family, and regretted being separated from them for such long periods. So to make sure that his children were fully equipped for life, John Quincy took an active hand in their education, including regarding their religious faith. <br /> <br />In 1811 while residing in St. Petersburg as President James Madison’s diplomat to Russia, he wrote nine lengthy letters to his son George Washington Adams (named for John Quincy’s close friend and mentor), instructing him not only in how to read through the Bible from cover to cover once each year but also how to get the most out of that reading. <br /> <br />This was not an unusual topic for Adams, for throughout his life he maintained a strong love of the Bible. He not only read and studied it in numerous languages (including Greek, French, Russian, German, and others), but was also an officer and leader of the infant American Bible Society, which continues today as the largest distributor of Bibles in the world. <br /> <br />When John Quincy Adams died in 1848 after seven decades of public service to his country, there was a high demand for his nine letters to his son on the Bible to be printed and distributed nationally so that all of America’s youth would benefit from his wise counsel. When that work was released, in speaking of Adams, the Editors noted that: ""It is no slight testimonial to the verity and worth of Christianity that in all ages since its promulgation, the great mass of those who have risen to eminence by their profound wisdom, integrity, and philanthropy, have recognized and reverenced in Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of the Living God."" <br /> <br />That 1848 book, titled The Letters of John Quincy Adams to His Son on the Bible and its Teachings, became an instant best-seller. It went through several reprints over subsequent years and its public popularity remained very high. This modern reprint makes the wisdom of John Quincy Adams available to this generation, and its wisdom is perfect for both youth and adults.</span></p>",1,,yes,taxable,,no,0,FALSE,FALSE,0,yes,1,No Backorders,FALSE,0,0,,FALSE,FALSE,4.99,0,0,0,0,0,Browse All;eBooks;

<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Too often scientists build their theories upon wild speculation or unfounded assumptions. Many new ideas turn out to be dead-ends. They neither advance science nor improve daily life. Some people distrust the claims of science. Can science really change the world?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Yes, indeed. The scientific discoveries of Louis Pasteur, a Frenchman who lived in the 1800s, have made a difference. He chose scientific questions worthy of attack, those whose solution would benefit ordinary citizens. Pasteurization grew out of his dramatic discovery that tiny living things cause foods like milk to spoil. Gentle heating of the milk destroys the tiny life and keeps the food fresh.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">He also proved that some microscopic living organisms are helpful to human beings, while others cause illness. His discovery that germs can cause disease is the foundation of modern medicine. It took a great deal of effort to prove the germ theory. Truth, not fleeting fame, motivated Louis Pasteur. He announced his results only after the most careful research in the laboratory and thorough tests in the field.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Some scientists resented it when Louis Pasteur showed the error in their favorite theories. Biologist violently opposed his proof that microscopic life could not spring into existence from nonliving elements. Veterinarians belittled his development of vaccines for chicken cholera and anthrax. Surgeons ignored his call for germ-free operating rooms to prevent infections during surgery. Doctors rejected the evidence that germs cause disease. These traditional-minded scientists launched personal attacks against Louis Pasteur. Louis Pasteur, however, didn't settle questions by arguments. He held dramatic public demonstrations so people could judge for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">If you listed the top ten scientists of all time, you would include Louis Pasteur near the top of the list. Yet, this great man was very religious, a Christian. Many times, he stated his belief that spiritual and religious values go beyond scientific knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Read <em>Louis Pasteur - Founder of Modern Medicine.</em> It traces in exciting details the events in the life of Louis Pasteur. Learn about his early life as the son of an obscure country tanner. Experience his years of struggle as an unknown scientist. Enjoy his triumph as one of the world's most celebrated heroes.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em>Noah Webster: Master of Words</em></span></strong><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small;"">Noah Webster might be best known for his complete dictionary that many of us still use today. However, he penned many other works. Do you know which of his works he was most pleased with? Webster's fondness for language was quite obvious throughout his life, but David R. Collins also highlights his love for education, his country and most importantly, God. Webster observed, ""What a man does with his life may or may not be remembered after he is gone. That does not matter. What matters is that a man's actions are worthy in the eyes of God and useful to his fellow man. I pray my life has been of worth and usefulness."" You will find that this biography gives you a portrait of how Webster made strides throughout his entire life to meet that standard.</span></p>

Simple Product,0,Noah Webster's 1828 Dictionary & the Bible (CD ROM),Webster's 1828 Dictionary (CD ROM),"<p>Founding Father Noah Webster had a significant impact on America. He was a soldier during the American Revolution and a legislator and a judge afterward; he was also one of the first Founders to call for a Constitutional Convention, and while he didn't sign it, Webster directly impacted the final wording of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Today, Webster is primarily known for the massive dictionary that bears his name. He published a small dictionary in 1806, and in 1807 began work on his great dictionary. While preparing that work and seeking to understand the origin of specific words, Webster learned over twenty languages. His two-volume masterpiece was finished and finally published in 1828. It contained some 70,000 words, including 12,000 words and 40,000 definitions not found in any previous dictionary.</p>
<p>This searchable CD ROM features Noah Webster's 1828 Dictionary, <em>An American Dictionary of the English Language</em>. It was the first dictionary ever published in America that original dictionary, published here in its entirety, was begun with a dedication to God, praying that it would be useful for ""the moral and religious elevation of character and the glory of my country."" For decades, it also contained Webster's personal testimony of his conversion to Christ. Additionally, after defining each word, he provided examples to clarify the meanings of the word, and a large percentage of his examples were Bible verses. (See the example of the word ""chief."")</p>
<p>This CD ROM also includes the full text of the King James Version of the Bible which is fully integrated with the Dictionary to enable fast, thorough word studies.</p>

Not only have we forgotten how we became the most stable and prosperous nation on the globe, but now we often feel compelled to apologize to the world just for being Americans. How did we develop such a serious national identity crisis? It came as a result of five specific historical attacks launched over the past century that have now found a permanent home in American media and education. Learn about each of the five attacks and how to quickly identify and negate its harmful influence so that Americans can once again regain an understanding of our greatness and preserve it for generations to come.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em><br />Robert Boyle: Trailblazer of of Science</em></span></strong><span style=""font-size: small;""><br /><br />Robert Boyle lived a life of contrasts. He was born to one of the richest families on earth, but he chose to live a simple life. Robert became one of the greatest scientists of all time, but remained a shy, humble person. Despite his quiet nature, he worked forcefully and bravely against persecution and injustice. His friends were a roll call of the famous: Christopher Wren, Samuel Pepys, John Milton, Isaac Newton and many others. Yet, during his life Robert Boyle towered over all of them.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Robert's brothers and sisters all received regal titles such as knight, viscount, earl, lord. However, Robert Boyle refused all titles. He preferred to remain what he was, a Christian gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Robert Boyle's father came to Ireland with nothing but a few coins in his pocket and a small trunk of clothes. He became the Great Earl of Cork, a powerful and wealthy Irish landowner. Like his father, Robert Boyle became famous, but in an entirely different way. He became the best known and most respected scientist of his day. Today, after three hundred years, he is still considered one of the top scientists of all time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Robert Boyle survived rebellions in Ireland, the English Civil War, the Black Death, the Great Fire and political unrest. He succeeded in making many remarkable discoveries during those difficult times. He lived a devout Christian life, using his science to glorify God.

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em>Samuel F.B. Morse: Artist with a Message</em></span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">The world-famous artist, Samuel Morse, boarded the packet ship <em>Sully</em> in France to sail for New York. He listened as other passengers tossed ideas back and forth. One man asked, ""Is the flow of electricity slowed by the length of a wire?"" Someone else responded, ""No.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">The thought captured Samuel's imagination. Could signals be sent instantly anywhere along a wire by electricity? Could newspapers in America carry news of events that had taken place that very morning in Europe? But an idea is not enough. It must be expressed in terms of wire, magnets, and batteries. He filled his notebook with dozens of drawings - diagrams of wire circuits, electromagnets, levers, switches, a moving strip of paper.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">When Samuel disembarked in New York, he immediately announced to his brothers, ""During the voyage, I made an important invention that will astonish the world. The telegraph is a way to communicate by means of electricity. The dots and spaces make it possible - ""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">""But what of your career as an artist?"" his brother interrupted. Samuel said, ""I could earn a good living as a painter. But for my invention to succeed, I should give full time to it."" And that's what Samuel did - for the next twelve years!<br /><br /></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Book Description:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Thomas Jefferson stands falsely accused of several crimes, among them infidelity and disbelief. Noted historian David Barton now sets the record straight.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Having borne the brunt of a smear campaign that started more than two centuries ago, the reputation and character of American president Thomas Jefferson shows considerable tarnish, as lies and misunderstandings have gathered on his legacy.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Noted early-America historian David Barton scours out the truth.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Jefferson and Sally: Did he really have children by his slave, Sally Hemings?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Jefferson and Jesus: Did he really abandon the faith of his family?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Jefferson and the Bible: Did he really want to rewrite the Scripture?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Jefferson and the church: Did he really advocate separation?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Jefferson and slaves: What is the truth about his slaveholding and his statements that all are created equal?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: small;"">Jefferson and education: Did Jefferson really found the first secular, irreligious university?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">All of these questions deserve the cleansing light of truth. Barton has gone through the historical records, combed the original documents and letters, and examined the recent evidence, and his findings will upset the establishment. Barton shows the true man, the Real Thomas Jefferson. Most readers will have the joy and surprise of meeting him for the very first time.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Life with Samuel took Susanna from her life-long home in London to a new home over a hundred miles to the north. Samuel was a minister, but life in the rectory was not easy. There was never enough money to feed and clothe the family properly. Twice their house burned. One king after another reigned on the throne of England. And Samuel spent years writing his commentary on the Book of Job.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Through it all, Susanna devoted herself to her children - nineteen were born, but only nine lived to grow up. Would little Samuel ever learn to talk? How could she make time to spend alone with each of her children? When should she teach the children to read? And would her life ever count for something? As a young woman, Susanna once said, ""I hope the fire I start will not only burn all of London, but all of the United Kingdom as well. I hope it will burn all over the world.""</span></p>

<p>In today&rsquo;s classrooms and civil arenas you will find little evidence of the Biblical principles upon which America was founded. In fact, many modern-day historians claim that our nation&rsquo;s Founders were a diverse group of atheists, deists, and political revolutionaries. But what principles did the Founding Fathers use as the basis for the most successful nation in history? Did they really intend for us to live in a secular society as revisionists claim? Or were they largely a group of God-fearing leaders who believed that Biblical principles should form the underpinning of our government and its Constitution?

<p>In today&rsquo;s society, Americans are increasingly taught false views about the religious and moral beliefs of our Founding Fathers.

<div id=""hideshow"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>In today’s classrooms and civil arenas you will find little evidence of the Biblical principles upon which America was founded. In fact, many modern-day historians claim that our nation’s Founders were a diverse group of atheists, deists, and political revolutionaries. But what principles did the Founding Fathers use as the basis for the most successful nation in history? Did they really intend for us to live in a secular society as revisionists claim? Or were they largely a group of God-fearing leaders who believed that Biblical principles should form the underpinning of our government and its Constitution? Discover the amazing truth of our nation’s Godly foundation in the American Heritage Series. America: this is your heritage!</p>

<div id=""hideshow2"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>In today’s society, Americans are increasingly taught false views about the religious and moral beliefs of our Founding Fathers. Were our Founding Fathers rebellious political zealots as many historians now teach? Or were they really men of integrity and strong religious character, as earlier generations and textbooks taught? View original documents that show, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that America’s Founders drew their ideas for this nation from their strong faith in God. As you watch, you will see numerous accounts of God’s intervention clearly visible in the lives and endeavors of our Founding Fathers. In the American Heritage Series, discover the faith of our Founders that enabled them selflessly to give their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor. America: this is your heritage!</p>

<div id=""hideshow3"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>Modern history teaches us that our Founding Fathers were atheists, agnostics, and deists yet a closer look into history tells us a different story. America’s founders were united by their deeply held spiritual beliefs, and those beliefs directly impacted the formation of the new nation. Significantly, the Bible was the source of many of the unique ideas and unprecedented principles laid out in our founding documents, but today we are no longer taught these truths about our founding; instead, we are taught a revisionist history in which religious faith is absent and God’s Providential hand is ignored.

<div id=""hideshow4"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>In present-day politics and government, the term ""separation of church and state"" is regularly used to prohibit expressions of religious faith in the public arena. However, for a century-and-a-half after the Constitution was written, that phrase meant exactly the opposite – it was used to preserve religious expressions <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">in</span></em> the public square. What was the origin of this now infamous phrase? When and how did its meaning change? Learn the history of this phrase and how its original meaning has been replaced with a completely secular one never intended by the author of the phrase.

<div id=""hideshow5"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>During the Revolutionary War, churches and clergy played a pivotal role, providing leadership in the political and military arenas and helping shape the intellectual ideas that took root in our founding documents. The Bible helped shape our nation’s government, educational system, and culture in general; and while today’s critics have relegated religious leaders to serving only within the four walls of the church, America’s early religious leaders believed that they were to be involved in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">every</span> aspect of life – including government. Is there still a role for churches and pastors to play in today’s political arena?

<div id=""hideshow6"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>Founding Father Alexander Hamilton announced to the nation during the ratification of the Constitution that, ""[T]he judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution. . . . [and] the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter."" Yet today, our religious freedoms and so many others of our once inalienable rights are now regularly threatened by this ""least dangerous"" branch.

<div id=""hideshow8"" class=""hideshow"" style=""display: none; text-align: justify;"">
<p>For centuries, America’s educational philosophy centered on teaching ""religion, morality, and knowledge"" – the three aspects set forward in 1789 in America’s first federal law addressing education. In fact, America’s great Founding Fathers and educational leaders spoke openly about the need for public education to inculcate these three elements. However, over the past half-century, a dramatic change has occurred, and a completely secular philosophy now dominates the American classroom. In fact, most Americans today are not only uninformed but often misinformed about the spiritual heritage of our nation and its Founders. What can history tell us about a nation who forgets its past?

<p>Unknown to most today, black and white soldiers often fought side-by-side in the fierce battles of the Revolutionary War that birthed our nation, and many black leaders played pivotal roles in our government in the 1700s and throughout the 1800s. Why do our classrooms neglect so many of our nation’s great black leaders – military heroes such as Peter Salem, influential pastors like Lemuel Haynes and Richard Allen, Revolutionary spy James Armistead, or U.

<p>Over the past two centuries, a dramatic change has occurred in America. The rich spiritual heritage of our Founding Fathers and the religious beliefs and values they incorporated through American government and institutions are now met with increasing hostility. Are we really in what many describe as a ""Cultural War""? Does the mixing of politics and faith create a dangerous environment within a nation, or does it actually preserve the unique principles that made the United States the most successful nation in history? In the American Heritage Series, discover the role that Biblical values played in our founding, how far America has drifted since that time, and what citizens today can do to return to restore those values.

Simple Product,0,The Jefferson Lies (B37),The Jefferson Lies: Exposing the Myths You've Always Believed About Thomas Jefferson (Book),"<p>Thomas Jefferson stands falsely accused of several crimes, among them infidelity and disbelief. Noted historian David Barton now sets the record straight.</p>
<p>Having borne the brunt of a smear campaign that started more than two centuries ago, the reputation and character of American president Thomas Jefferson shows considerable tarnish, as lies and misunderstandings have gathered on his legacy.</p>
<p>Noted early-America historian David Barton scours out the truth.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Jefferson and Sally: Did he really have children by his slave, Sally Hemings?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Jefferson and Jesus: Did he really abandon the faith of his family?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Jefferson and the Bible: Did he really want to rewrite the Scripture?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Jefferson and the church: Did he really advocate separation?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Jefferson and slaves: What is the truth about his slaveholding and his statements that all are created equal?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Jefferson and education: Did Jefferson really found the first secular, irreligious university?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these questions deserve the cleansing light of truth. Barton has gone through the historical records, combed the original documents and letters, and examined the recent evidence, and his findings will upset the establishment.

Simple Product,0,The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth (NWB18),"Commonly and incorrectly called The Jefferson Bible
Reprint of an original","<p><span style=""font-size: 11pt;""><em><strong>The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth <br /></strong></em>Commonly and incorrectly called ""The Jefferson Bible<strong>""</strong><em><strong><br /></strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11pt;""><strong>Notes on the So-Called Jefferson Bible</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Jefferson spent years of his life studying the moral teachings of great leaders ranging from Cato to Socrates, and Plato to Cicero. He concluded that those of Jesus were superior to all others. In 1820, he compiled over 80 of those teachings into what he titled <em>The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">He explained to his friends that he had compiled <em>“every text…of the moral precepts of Jesus”</em> so he could more closely study <em>“the most sublime edifice of morality which had ever been exhibited to man.”</em> That work included seminal moral teachings of Jesus, including the Good Samaritan, the Golden Rule, turning the other cheek, forgiving offenders, kindness to an enemy, the Lord’s Prayer, the Great Commandment, and many others.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Over time, this work became known as <em>The Jefferson Bible </em>(even though Jefferson himself would have disputed that title). Many today claim that Jefferson was cutting out the parts of the Bible he didn’t agree with, but that’s clearly not the case. The story of Thomas Jefferson’s faith is vast, complex, and fascinating. To learn more about the true history behind <em>The Jefferson Bible take a look at</em> <a href=""https://shop.wallbuilders.com/the-jefferson-lies-b37b"" target=""_blank"">The Jefferson Lies</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">In the meantime, enjoy reading <em>The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth</em>!</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">This time, they carried the glider almost to the top of Big Kill Devil Hill.</span><br /><span style=""font-size: small;""> ""Ready?"" asked Orville.</span><br /><span style=""font-size: small;""> ""Ready,"" replied Wilbur from his prone position.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Safely in the air, Wilbur warped the wings. There was an instant response and Wilbur glowed with joy. But as the glider curved, he became aware of a new instability. He adjusted the controls. There was little response. True, the glider turned. Still - although puzzled, he managed a safe landing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">On his fifth flight that day, Wilbur became aware of increasing instability. Then the left wing dipped far too deeply. Frantically he pushed the elevator control. He was too late. The tip of the left wing bit into the sand and he was hurled forward against the canvas elevator.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">The birds all knew the secret of turning while in flight. But their secret was so deep no one could solve it. People said it was impossible for a heavier-than-air machine to fly. But Wilbur and Orville were determined to show the world that it could be done!</span></p>

Simple Product,0,U-Turn: Restoring America to the Strength of its Roots (Bargain Bin B39Z),By George Barna & David Barton (Hardback Book),"<p><span style=""background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);"">The United States became a stable, prosperous, and unique nation because of our faith in God and the willingness of our citizens to apply Biblical principles and values in every aspect of life. But over recent decades, personal egocentricity has placed self above God, seriously eroding and endangering America's long-found strength and security. In their new book, <strong><em>U-Turn: Restoring America to the Strength of Its Roots, </em></strong>historian David Barton and researcher/pollster George Barna examine the cultural trends of the past forty years, giving readers a unique view of the current moral and spiritual condition of Americans while providing specific recommendations on how we can restore our families, churches and government back to a place of Biblical conformity, and thus God's blessing.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000;"">America truly is a blessed nation. In so many important categories, she represents the exception rather than the rule among the nations of the world. Our exceptionalism encompasses great diversity of race, ethnicity, and religion, and has benefited every American.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; color: #000000;"">But today, American Exceptionalism is no longer understood or venerated. Following several decades of indoctrination in both education and politics, many Americans now seem ashamed of their country and feel compelled to apologize to others for it. We have been taught America's flaws but little of its matchless benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; color: #000000;""><em>What produced the blessings we take for granted that so many other nations only dream of?</em> The answer is found in five principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence. Discover these principles and learn what every citizen can do to restore America's greatness.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">William Bradford (1590-1657) grew up in a small town in England during a time of upheaval and opportunity. Together with a group of Separatits, William escaped England to establish a new life in Holland and finally set out on the <em>Mayflower</em> on a perilous voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. The New World beckoned as a land of freedom and possibility. Yet wild waters, icy winters, Indian attacks, starvation, and treason threatened the European settlers' very existence. Through William's vision and steadfast leadership, the people of Plymouth Colony would endure, their future descendants forming the cornerstone of a great nation.<br /><br /></span><span style=""font-size: small;"">The stories of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Heroes of History </span>are told in an engaging narrative format, where related history, geography, government, and science topics come to life and make a lasting impression.</span> <br /></span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em>William Jennings Bryan: Golden-Tongued Orator<br /></em></span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">Every member of Congress was in his place. The gallery was crowded and people stood along the walls and jammed the hallways. William Jennings Bryan was about to speak. He stood tall and strong, a handsome figure, smartly dressed, in western boots.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">Everywhere Bryan spoke, excited crowds cheered and applauded. He was called the golden-tongued orator yet he was known as the Great Commoner, fighting for the common people against the power of big corporation and monopolies, fighting against evils in society and government.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">Bryan could help even the children in his audiences to understand the big issues. ""When you buy one dollar's worth of starch,"" he said in a farming town, ""you pay sixty cents for the starch and forty cents for the trusts and the tariff.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">As a schoolboy, Bryan failed to place at all in the first speech contest he entered. Practicing in the fields and woods, speaking with pebbles in his mouth as he heard Demosthenes of ancient Greece had done, planning all year long for upcoming contests, he began to win prizes. While still a youth, he determined to emulate Cicero and use what eloquence and power he might attain, not for himself, but for those who were oppressed. And throughout his life he held to that decision.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">A great Christian and a great American, William Jennings Bryan left an indelible mark upon America and upon the world.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: small;"">William Penn (1644-1718) worked passionately for religious freedom in a world where freedoms were subject to the whims of rulers. With the favor William's father enjoyed in the British royal court, all William had to do was show himself to be a faithful royalist, and wealth and privilege would be his. Instead, he chose to follow his conscience–to expulsion from university, disinheritance, imprisonment, and the threat of death. When this Quaker reformer secured a land grant in America, he laid for Pennsylvania a foundation of liberty, jusitice, fairness, and tolerance that would later guide the drafting of the Constitution of the United States. <br /><br /></span><span style=""font-size: small;"">The stories of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Heroes of History </span>are told in an engaging narrative format, where related history, geography, government, and science topics come to life and make a lasting impression.</span> <br /></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Florence went against the wishes of her wealthy parents and defied social custom when she took up a career that no respectable woman of that day would even consider. She became a nurse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">History knows her now as ""The Lady with the Lamp."" Night after night she walked among the cots of wounded soldiers, carrying her kerosene lamp to light the darkness and wearing her cape to keep out the cold. She was always ready to bandage the wounds of a bleeding soldier, give a drink of water to a thirsty patient, or write a letter home for a private on his deathbed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Up until Florence's time, the hospitals in England were a disgrace. Could she better conditions? She would have to overcome the resistance of high officials, the apathy of the public, and even the ignorance of doctors. Throughout her life, Florence remembered the entry in her diary when she was still a girl: ""God spoke to me and called me to His service.""</span></span></p>

On a frontier steeped in both danger and great possibility, Laura would grow up to witness firsthand the rapid transformation of the West as pioneers and covered wagons gave way to farms, towns, and railroads.<br /> </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Susanna, the twenty-fifth child in her family, prayed daily, ""Dear God, guide me. Make my life count."" But God's answer seemed to be ""<em>Wait.</em>"" So Susanna waited. And in the meantime, she married the young poet, Samuel Wesley.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Life with Samuel took Susanna from her life-long home in London to a new home over a hundred miles to the north. Samuel was a minister, but life in the rectory was not easy. There was never enough money to feed and clothe the family properly. Twice their house burned. One king after another reigned on the throne of England. And Samuel spent years writing his commentary on the Book of Job.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">Through it all, Susanna devoted herself to her children - nineteen were born, but only nine lived to grow up. Would little Samuel ever learn to talk? How could she make time to spend alone with each of her children? When should she teach the children to read? And would her life ever count for something? As a young woman, Susanna once said, ""I hope the fire I start will not only burn all of London, but all of the United Kingdom as well. I hope it will burn all over the world.""</span></p>

<p>Over 2200 pages, this Bible is chock-full of full-color insert pages on major themes found throughout our founding, highlights little known and relevant insights from the Founders on their commitment to the importance of the Bible, and includes subject index, concordance and Bible maps.</p>
<p><em>Exceptional</em> DVD<br />Length: 60 min.<br /><br />Description:<br />America truly is a blessed nation. In so many important categories, she respresents the exception rather than the rule among the nations of the world. Our exceptionalism encompasses great diversity of race, ethnicity, and religion, and has benefited every American.</p>
<p>But today, American Exceptionalism is no longer understood or venerated. Following several decades of indoctrination in both education and politics, many Americans now seem ashamed of their country and feel compelled to apologize to others for it. We have been taught America's flaws but little of its matchless benefits.</p>
<p><em>What produced the blessings we take for granted that so many other nations only dream of?</em> The answer is found in five principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence. Discover these principles and learn what every citizen can do to restore America's greatness.</p>",0,FBSH01,no,taxable,media,yes,0,FALSE,FALSE,0,yes,20,Allow Qty Below0,FALSE,1,10000,,FALSE,FALSE,114.94,0,4.5,2.19,9.25,7.38,

<p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;""><strong>The Founders&rsquo; Bible - Heirloom Edition </strong>is signature historian David Barton&rsquo;s most significant life&rsquo;s work. While this premium edition has all the bells and whistles, perhaps its most important feature is that it preserves for all time America&rsquo;s Founding Documents by including <em>the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States</em>, <em>the Bill of Rights</em> and subsequent amendments. Having all of this in one single resource alongside the Bible that inspired such wisdom from the Founders makes the Heirloom Edition the &ldquo;ultimate resource.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">The Heirloom Edition showcases a richly tanned, deep-cinnamon brown Lux Leather binding. It&rsquo;s extremely durable, with beautiful rounded corners, handcrafted gold foil textured imprints on both the cover and spine, which feature distinctive debossing, genuine perimeter, hand-stitching, and the more formal gold gilded edging. The Heirloom Edition will be a cherished family treasure for generations. Each copy comes individually shrink-wrapped in an exquisite presentation slipcase that captures the beauty of the commissioned cover artwork and also provides a safe resting space for your Bible when not in use.</span></p>
